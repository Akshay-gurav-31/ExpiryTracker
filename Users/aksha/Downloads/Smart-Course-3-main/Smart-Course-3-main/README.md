## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EduMatch AI-smart-course.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd EduMatch AI-smart-course
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser

*Note: No build tools or dependencies are required. The application runs directly in the browser.*

## Usage

1. Enter keywords related to your learning interests in the input field
2. Press `Enter` to add keywords (e.g., "Python", "Web Development", "AI")
3. View personalized course recommendations ranked by relevance
4. Browse through pages of recommendations using the pagination controls
5. Remove keywords by clicking the "X" button on keyword badges

## Course Database

The application includes a comprehensive database of 100+ courses across various categories:
- Programming (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Web Development (React, Vue, Angular, HTML/CSS, Node.js, etc.)
- Mobile Development (React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin)
- Data Science (Data Analysis, Machine Learning, AI, Statistics)
- Design (UI/UX, Figma, Adobe XD)
- DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- Cybersecurity
- And many more...

Each course includes detailed information such as:
- Title and description
- Category and difficulty level
- Duration and provider
- Student ratings and enrollment numbers
- Price information
- Relevant tags for matching

## Technical Implementation

### Course Ranking Algorithm

The recommendation system uses a sophisticated algorithm that considers:
1. **Tag Matching**: Direct and partial matches between user keywords and course tags
2. **Course Ratings**: Higher-rated courses receive preference
3. **Popularity**: Courses with more students enrolled are prioritized
4. **Randomization**: Slight randomization to provide varied recommendations

### Star Background Animation

The immersive galaxy background is implemented using HTML5 Canvas with:
- 800 stars with varying sizes, colors, and brightness
- Depth simulation through z-axis positioning
- Realistic twinkling effects with opacity variations
- Smooth motion trails for a cinematic experience

### Responsive Design

The application uses CSS media queries to provide optimal experiences across devices:
- Flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Adjustable font sizes for readability
- Device-specific interaction patterns (action buttons for mobile)
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest versions)
- Firefox (latest versions)
- Safari (latest versions)
- Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Performance Optimization

- Efficient DOM manipulation techniques
- Minimal reflows and repaints
- Optimized JavaScript algorithms
